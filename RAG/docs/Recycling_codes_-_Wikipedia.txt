TITULO: Recycling codes - Wikipedia

 From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Code identifying material, for recycling Recycling codes on products Recycling codes are used to identify the materials out of which the item is made, to facilitate easier recycling process 
The presence on an item of a recycling code, a chasing arrows logo, or a resin code , is not an automatic indicator that a material is recyclable; it is an explanation of what the item is made of
Codes have been developed for batteries , biomatter/organic material , glass , metals , paper , and plastics. [ 1 ] Various countries have adopted different codes
For example, the table below shows the polymer resin (plastic) codes
In the United States there are fewer, because ABS is placed with"others" in group 7. A number of countries have a finer-grained system with more recycling codes
For example, China's polymer identification system has seven different classifications of plastic, five different symbols for post-consumer paths, and 140 identification codes. [ 2 ] The lack of a code system in some countries has encouraged those who fabricate their own plastic products, such as RepRap and other prosumer 3-D printer users, to adopt a voluntary recycling code based on the more comprehensive Chinese system.

They provide an alternative that eliminates confusion as people often mistake any resin code to be recyclable, but this is not necessarily true
The recyclability of the numbers depends on the abilities of the facilities in the community. [ 9 ] Thus, they are not all automatically recyclable. How2Recycle is a project that started in 2008. [ 10 ] The label provides information about the packaging material and clearly indicates whether it is recyclable, partially or totally
 If it is not recyclable at all, it is shown by a diagonal line going through the recycling label. OPRL is a not-for-profit organisation that provides simple, consistent 'recycle' & 'refill' labels for retailer & brand packaging in the UK market
The labels clearly state whether the packaging is recyclable or not, helping consumers recycle better, more often.
